# Angular  Node Template

This template contains a great starting place to create an Angular app with a Node backend:

- Client
	- Angular 5
		- Routing
		- `HttpClient`
	- Bootstrap 4
- Server
	- Node
	- Express


### Install

Open two console tabs: One inside of `client/` and one inside of `server/`.

Run `npm install` from both tabs.

### Run

`npm start` from inside `client/` and from inside `server/`.
